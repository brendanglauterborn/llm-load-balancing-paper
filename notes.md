# Main Topics

## Problem

The demand for LLMs and generative AI on network strain
[LLMs generate lots of traffic](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10688v1)

- Multi-modal LLMs can generate lots of traffic
- Training takes in a lot of data
- AI agents accessing the internet
- RAG applications accessing the data

## Predicting Network Traffic

## Reinforcement Learning for optimizing networks

For each algorithm, mention the following:
- Limitations and challenges
- The results based on simulations

Training a model's behavior through reward and punishment
> In the majority of these papers that used reinforcement learning, the Q-learning algorithm was utilized throughout the different articles.

A lower response time leads to higher rewards. This could lead to 

### Limitations

- Long training times, depending on the environment. Deep reinforcement learning may help

### Possible improvements

- Edge Computing
